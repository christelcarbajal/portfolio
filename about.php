            My name is Christel Carbajal Torres and I am currently 30 years old. I was born and raised in Curacao but my
            roots are 100% Venezuelan.
            I speak several languages such as Spanish, English, Dutch, Papiamento, a little Arabic and Portuguese.

            Since I was a child, I have been a fan of video-games and game consoles.
            And of the whole technological field, as a matter of fact. However, it wasn’t until 4 years ago that I
            started to focus on developing games and programming.
            The reason why I didn’t focus on programming earlier was that I decided to focus on science instead and.
            Consequently - in 2016 – I graduated as an analyst in biotechnology and started working at Janssen Biologics
            (a pharmaceutical company owned by Johnson & Johnson).

            Because I am eager to learn new things, I challenged myself to proceed in programming. I started building my
            own pc, configured my own Raspberry Pi with retro-games to add to my collection of (especially) console
            games.
            <br>
            January of 2020 I started a Specialization in Coursera on “Game Design & Development” which contained 5
            courses, of which I completed 3 already.
            The other 2 are still pending, though, due to work and my studies. Since September 2020, namely, I have been
            studying CMGT (Creative Media & Game Technologies) at Rotterdam University of Applied Science.
            The reason I started this course was to gain more experience and knowledge as a starting programmer. There
            is a lot to learn, and I just got started.
            Before I started I had no idea of coding, and I guess I was a little afraid it wasn’t for me, but I decided
            to
            give it a shot.
            And after having done some small projects, I quickly realized that this is where my heart is.

            I developed my love for game development thanks to the Ubisoft company. I have always been such a fan of
            most of the Ubisoft games, like Assassin’s Creed & Tom Clancy’s franchise.
            I admire the spectacular idea of introducing a series of features, such as science fiction intertwined with
            historical events in the real world, that was just amazing.
            I loved the idea of learning history from a video game, so I questioned myself, what if I could learn new
            things that way?
            Could it be possible to make a video game where you could have fun but at the same time learn new things?
            Imagine in the future children learning their subjects through a video game?
            That would be amazing. So that is why I decided to choose this path to expand my knowledge and my creativity
            in this field.
